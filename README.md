# ml_graph
* I created this project to help me understand how machine learning theory works in code.

A python simple graph, which is structured in a way to understand how models works and how data gets processed in model.
This project is still at initial stage. 

Currently it needs some math library implementation that could do the derivations for weights and bais.
